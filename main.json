The interaction between the Deadpath and the Gossamer is what allows eidolons to manifest.",

The tether formed between the dreaming mind of a caller and the waking mind of the eidolon allows the caller to pour a portion of the Eidolon's consciousness into a physical body called a Form. The size, number, and power of the Form summoned can change depending on the Bond forged during their initial encounter in the Gossamer.",

The caller is the window by which the eidolon can view the physical world: and the adventures that a caller embarks on are an addictive interest to an eternal yet ephemeral creature like an Eidolon. When the caller sleeps, the eidolon and caller share in their dreams and half-rememberances of past adventures. A caller and eidolon are connected even beyond their mortal lives, as they find their lifelong friend waiting to guide them in the Deadpath towards their next life."
